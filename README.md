# ft_printf
*Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough*

Summary:
> TThe goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that?? It is actually pretty cool :)

# Usage
```bash
$ make
```
